# CaReminder-App

Developed in 2022 as the practical component of my high school IB Computer Science class.

CaReminder is a multi-user web-app solution for medicinal record-keeping. 
The app allows for multiple user accounts, each managing multiple patients, with each patient having a list of tracked medicines and their details.

The frontend utilises the Qt toolkit to build a cross-platform GUI, through the Python binding PyQt.

The backend is a Flask web-application connecting to a MySQL relational database, running on PythonAnywhere, a free online hosting solution.
